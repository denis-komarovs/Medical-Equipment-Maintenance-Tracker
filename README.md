# Medical Equipment Maintenance Tracker

## Overview
**Medical Equipment Maintenance Tracker (MEMT)** is a web-based system for hospitals and clinics to manage:
- Medical equipment inventory
- Scheduled maintenance
- Fault reporting and resolution
- Vendor contact management
- Compliance-ready reporting

## Skills Learnt and/or Used
- **Laravel & PHP Development**: Built a full backend system using Laravel's MVC structure.
- **Database Management**: Designed and managed a relational MySQL database.
- **Frontend Development (Vue.js)**: Built dynamic, responsive front-end components using Vue.js.
- **API Creation**: Developed RESTful APIs to enable external systems and mobile apps to interact with the data.
- **UI/UX Design Principles**: Created a clean UI & UX experience.
- **Testing & Debugging**: Wrote automated PHPUnit tests and performed manual testing. Due to time constraints this hasnt been done properly
- **Version Control (Git)**: Used Git for version control with feature branches, clear commit messages, and organized project management.
- **Kanban/Agile Workflows**: Planned and managed project tasks using a Kanban board to simulate an Agile workflow.
- **Best Practice Coding Standards**: Followed PSR-12 coding standards and wrote clean, maintainable code.
- **Problem-Solving & Critical Thinking**: Analyzed project requirements and solved technical challenges like overdue maintenance tracking and role-based permissions.
- **Collaboration & Communication**: although I worked solo for this project I simulated teamwork qualities by writing clear documentation, reviewing code & having good project organisation
